There are 4 functions in the script.js file that cycle, and therefore the computer will respond in different (simple) ways. Briefly:
1. Reverses your message
2. Converts your text to uppercase
3. Responds with the vowels included in your message
4. This one is a surprise (unless you already checked the source file)
